# Fully automated brain MRI sorting and artifacts detection based on image contents

This is the official implementation of “A lightweight deep learning framework for automatic MRI data sorting and artifacts detection” published in Journal of Medical Systems.

10 common MR imaging sequences and 3 most typical artifacts that can be classified by the model. (T1w: T1-weighted, T1c: contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, FLAIR: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, MRA: magnetic resonance angiography, other: MRI images from parts other than brain) ![labels](labels.png)
